# **Synthesis of Adversarial DDoS Attacks Using Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks**

### Project Description

Create Real-Time Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) that detect incoming malicious traffic
in real time using Random Forest and Kafka and evaluate the system with generated new artificial
malicious traffic using GANs.
